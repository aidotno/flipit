# Create a variable to store the unix time.

# Make a link...oh I mean FlipItâ„¢
# The -s flag tells the system to make a [symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link). This is important
#   and also very handy for a lot of things. If you've ever used [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/valet)
#   before, you've been creating symbolic links! Well worth investigating.
# The -h flag tells the system not to follow any symbolic links. This was doing
#   my head in I ended up with ./public_html/public_html links! Inception!
# the -f flag tells the system that if a link already exists, remove it and add
#   this link instead.
